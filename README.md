This repository was created to track fixes and additions to the Progressive Contact WordPress site.

So far:

Fixed margins on the Faq Page.

Searched and replaced image links that broke migrating to a new URL.

Upgrade allowed for wider Faq Cells

Added some javascript to the faq.php file to make the FAQ Titles show only when there are more than one FAQ per page. If there's only one FAQ on the page the redundant Title is removed.
